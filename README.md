Practice Application

This project is a practice project for educational purposes.

The application is part of an Android Development for Beginners course that I am following to learn the basics of Android development.

Even with extensive Java and Java EE experience from years prior, the advent of mobile applications and modern web design introduced a lot of new terms and concepts that are fairly foreign to one that has been stuck with working with legacy software/code for years.

The code of this project is similar to what is taught in the course, with minor personal touches and refactoring.

I will also try to extend the application and add possible polishes after it is feature complete, as to slowly introduce new stuff to my learning.
